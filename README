This research project attempts to change a given text's sentiment without altering its structure/

TODO either try to fit the method in link 1 to a multiclass problem, or get binary data instead

1. Possible entire implementation of classifier including access to influential words:

2. Amazon 8 million review data set:

Not sure if this is needed but I wrote some code that uses pre-trained models from 'gensim' to turn words into
vectors using the Word2Vec algorithm. This might help since, using this technique, similar words are mapped to
similar vectors. That makes it easier make good context of words and sentences.

I might need to map whole reviews into vectors as well.
