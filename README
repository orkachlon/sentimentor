# interactive-ml-project-1
First project in the course 'Machine learning as a tool for interactive products'


Planning to use Amazon movie dataset. It's too big to add so here's the link to
where I got it from: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html

Not sure if this is needed but I wrote some code that uses pretrained models from 'gensim' to turn words into
vectors using the Word2Vec algorithm. This might help since, using this technique, similar words are mapped to
similar vectors. That makes it easier make good context of words and sentences.

I might need to map whole reviews into vectors as well.

TODO Change make names clearer (/models/, model.py)
